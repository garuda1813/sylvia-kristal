                Sylvia Maria Kristel (28 September 1952 – 17 October 2012) was a Dutch actress and model who appeared in over 50 films.

                Kristel gained international attention in 1974 for playing the title character in the softcore film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emmanuelle</a>, 
                which remains one of the most successful French films ever produced.

                Ms. Kristel was a willowy, dark-haired model and beauty contest winner in her early 20s with scant acting experience when she was cast by the French director Just Jaeckin as Emmanuelle, 
                the wife of a French diplomat in Bangkok who seeks solace for her boredom in a variety of sexual encounters. 
                With its simulated sex scenes shot largely in soft focus, an exotic locale and a sentimental pop score, 
                the film became an avatar of soft-core pornography.

                An immediate hit in France — it stayed at the same theater in Paris for several years — and later in Japan, 
                where it was perceived as a triumph of feminism (mostly, Ms. Kristel pointed out, for one scene in which Emmanuelle climbs on top of her husband during sex).

                She was considered for the role of Lois Lane in Superman (1978), which went to another actress. 
                Sylvia unsuccessfully applied for the role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_girl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bond Girl</a> in the movies: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Octopussy (1983).

                Her Emmanuelle typecasting image followed her to the United States, where she played Nicole Mallow, a maid who seduces a teenaged boy in the sex comedy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Lessons_(1981_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Private Lessons (1981)</a>.
                Although Private Lessons was one of the highest-grossing independent films of 1981 (<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/1981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">ranking number 28 in US domestic gross</a>), 
                Kristel reportedly saw none of the profits and continued to appear in movies and last played Emmanuelle in the early 1990s.
