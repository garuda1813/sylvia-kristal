                Sylvia Maria Kristel (28 September 1952 – 17 October 2012) was a Dutch actress and model who appeared in over 50 films.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kristel gained international attention in 1974 for playing the title character in the softcore film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emmanuelle</a>, 
                which remains one of the most successful French films ever produced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ms. Kristel was a willowy, dark-haired model and beauty contest winner in her early 20s with scant acting experience when she was cast by the French director Just Jaeckin as Emmanuelle, 
                the wife of a French diplomat in Bangkok who seeks solace for her boredom in a variety of sexual encounters. 
                With its simulated sex scenes shot largely in soft focus, an exotic locale and a sentimental pop score, 
                the film became an avatar of soft-core pornography.

            <p>
                An immediate hit in France — it stayed at the same theater in Paris for several years — and later in Japan, 
                where it was perceived as a triumph of feminism (mostly, Ms. Kristel pointed out, for one scene in which Emmanuelle climbs on top of her husband during sex).
            </p>
            <p>
                She was considered for the role of Lois Lane in Superman (1978), which went to another actress. 
                Sylvia unsuccessfully applied for the role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_girl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bond Girl</a> in the movies: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Octopussy (1983).
            </p>
            <p>
                Her Emmanuelle typecasting image followed her to the United States, where she played Nicole Mallow, a maid who seduces a teenaged boy in the sex comedy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Lessons_(1981_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Private Lessons (1981)</a>.
                Although Private Lessons was one of the highest-grossing independent films of 1981 (<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/1981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">ranking number 28 in US domestic gross</a>), 
                Kristel reportedly saw none of the profits and continued to appear in movies and last played Emmanuelle in the early 1990s.
